# Priority Task Manager w/ useReducer()

Task manager project written in React + TypeScript + Vite with Tailwind CSS for styling (and some shadcn ui). Wanted something to practice the useReducer hook which helps manage more complex state in React, so I built this. Check out the [live demo](https://priority-task-manager.vercel.app/)
